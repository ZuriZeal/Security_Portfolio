Domain registration data

HTTPS security posture

Social signals

Infrastructure details

Observed Red Flags

Inconsistent branding across websites (SEVENTY, LC GROUP, Mercor)

Domain lacking HTTPS support

Affiliate labeling on Reddit

Third-party tracking links

Mixed salary formatting

Public user comments labeling the opportunity as a scam

Domain Intelligence

Domain: mercor.com
Registrar: Namecheap, Inc.
Name Servers: AWS DNS

DNSSEC: Unsigned

WHOIS data collected from Ubuntu lab VM.

Technical Findings

HTTPS not supported on prolcgroup.com (certificate issue)

Risk Assessment

While mercor.com appears older and legitimate infrastructure-wise, the job distribution method and inconsistent branding introduce elevated social engineering risk.

Confidence level: Medium risk — possible affiliate funnel or deceptive recruitment marketing.

Recommendation

Avoid payment requests or onboarding fees.

Verify company legitimacy via official corporate channels.
